# cek

List, inspect and explore OCI container images, their layers and contents.

CEK is a command-line utility for exploring OCI container images without running
them. It can read images directly from local container daemons (Docker, Podman,
containerd, etc.) or pull them from remote registries, allowing you to inspect
metadata, browse files and directories, read file contents, and compare image
versions or layers.

## Installation

```text
go install github.com/bschaatsbergen/cek@latest
```

Or build from source:

```text
git clone https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/cek.git
cd cek
go build -o cek .
```

## Usage

### Inspect image metadata

View image details including digest, creation time, architecture, total size,
and individual layer information.

```text
cek inspect nginx:latest
Image: nginx:latest
Registry: index.docker.io
Digest: sha256:ec0ee8695f2f71addca9b40f27df0fdfbde460485a2b68b834e18ea856542f1e

### List files in an image

By default, `cek ls` shows the merged overlay filesystem, which is what you see
inside a running container. All layers are combined, with upper layers
overriding lower ones.

```text
# Show all files (merged overlay view)
cek ls nginx:latest

# Filter by pattern (supports doublestar glob matching)
cek ls --filter '**/nginx/*.conf' nginx:latest

# Show files from a specific layer only
cek ls --layer 1 nginx:latest
```

Patterns without slashes match against basenames. Patterns with slashes match
against full paths. Use `**` for recursive directory matching.

### Read file contents

Write file contents to standard output from any image without creating a
container. Output can be piped to other commands or redirected to files for
inspection, diffing, or processing.

```bash
cek cat nginx:latest /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Read from a specific layer
cek cat --layer 2 nginx:latest /etc/os-release

# Pipe to other tools
cek cat alpine:latest /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID

# Compare configuration between image versions
diff <(cek cat nginx:1.25 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf) \
     <(cek cat nginx:1.24 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)
```

The `cat` command searches layers top-down to find the final file state after
all overlays, just like in a running container.

### Compare two image tags

Compare images from the same repository to see what changed between versions.
Only files from unique layers are analyzed, making comparisons fast even for
large images with shared base layers.

```text
cek compare alpine:3.19 alpine:3.18
```

The comparison skips shared base layers automatically, reducing I/O for images
with common ancestry.

## Container Runtime Support

cek works with Docker, Podman, Colima, containerd, and nerdctl by connecting to
the container daemon socket. The daemon provides access to locally cached
images, avoiding rate limits when exploring images you've already pulled.

Set `DOCKER_HOST` to point to your runtime's socket:

```text
# Docker (standard Linux)
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock

# Docker Desktop (macOS)
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock

# Colima (macOS)
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.colima/default/docker.sock

# Podman (Linux with XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock

# Podman Machine (macOS)
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman.sock
```

If `DOCKER_HOST` is not set, cek will attempt to use the default Docker socket
location.

## Pull Policies

cek defaults to `if-not-present` to avoid registry rate limits. Images are
fetched from your local container daemon cache when available, falling back to
the remote registry only if needed.

```text
# Use local cache if available, pull if missing (default)
cek inspect --pull if-not-present nginx:latest

# Always pull from registry, even if cached locally
# Useful for checking if :latest tag has been updated
cek inspect --pull always nginx:latest

# Only use local cache, never pull from registry
# Useful for offline work or avoiding network calls
cek inspect --pull never nginx:latest
```

Images pulled by `docker pull`, `nerdctl pull` or `podman pull` are immediately
available to cek without additional downloads.

When using `if-not-present`, cek checks the local container daemon first. If the
image exists locally, it's used immediately without any network calls. If not
found locally, cek pulls from the remote registry.
